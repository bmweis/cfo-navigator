"""Optional: use the Claude API to generate a clean summary + auto-tags.

This replaces what Feedly used to do for you, but on a schema you control —
which is what makes the library more searchable than Feedly was.

Requires the `anthropic` SDK and an API key:
    pip install anthropic
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

Defaults to Opus for depth: the summary is the material the Ask assistant
reasons from and the resale-safe surface, so quality matters more than the
per-article cost of a one-time or low-volume run. Override with
LINKLIB_ENRICH_MODEL. The web pickers source their options from
``linklib.models`` (curated registry reconciled with the live Models API).

_PROMPT = """You are enriching a curated research library for a specific audience:
finance leaders at high-growth technology companies — people running FP&A or
strategic finance at a startup or scaleup, and the operators and founders growing
into that work.

The library powers two things: (1) an AI assistant that ANSWERS finance questions
by retrieving and synthesizing these articles, and (2) a search box. So the
summary must be substantive and retrievable — it is the material the assistant
reasons from, not a teaser.

Given an article's title and text, return STRICT JSON only (no prose, no markdown
fences) with exactly these four keys:

  "summary": 4-7 sentences, written to be retrieved and reasoned from. Lead with
     the article's central claim or recommendation. Include the specific figures
     it gives (benchmarks, ranges, percentages, multiples) and name the
     frameworks, metrics, formulas, companies, and people it discusses. Make
     explicit the practical question(s) a finance leader could use this article
     to answer. Favor concrete, searchable terms over generic description.

  "tags": 3-7 topic tags. PREFER reusing tags from this existing vocabulary
     wherever they fit (match the wording exactly):
{known}

     Only invent a new lowercase tag when nothing in the vocabulary fits.
{guide_block}
  "in_scope": true or false. TRUE if this is a WRITTEN ARTICLE useful to a finance
     leader, founder, or executive at a high-growth tech company — INCLUDING venture
     capital and fundraising content that helps operators (how investors evaluate
     metrics, term sheets, board management, raising a round).

     The audience is OPERATORS — finance leaders, founders, and executives running
     companies. So return FALSE when the piece is off-audience — most importantly
     content about pursuing a personal CAREER in venture capital (how to break into
     VC, get a job at a fund, become an investor), or material unrelated to
     operating and finance leadership.
     Otherwise, when in doubt, return true.

  "scope_reason": one short phrase explaining the in_scope decision (e.g.
     "operator fundraising guidance - keep", "how to get a job in VC - off-audience").
